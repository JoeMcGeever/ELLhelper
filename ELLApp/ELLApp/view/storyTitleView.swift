//this view is mostly visual, with an unwind segue

//the way the stories should work:
//a user selects the story they want to read from a table view scroll
//(the stories should have in the table view: pic, title, description, status (finished / reading etc) and maybe difficulty
//when selected, the following 3 pages are shown (maybe 2)
//which hold a template for the stories to populate
//the second page holds an image section up top, and text atr bottom
// the stories are stored in core data -> all identifiable by a number / title
//e.g: story1image1, story1text1, story2image2 ... <-- all ones with prefix story1 is gathered to populate the pages
//then the second page is looped over story1textN (N) times
